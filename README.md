Budget Web App 2.0

This Budget Web App 2.0 is created using:-
- FRONTEND: HTML, CSS & SCSS, and Vanilla JavaScript
- BACKEND: Node JS
- DATABASE: MongoDB 

As for the moment this Budget Web App 2.0 is treated as an API due to my lack of knowledge. Instead of building it as an Web App itself I used JavaScript Fetch call to handle all data transfered between the FRONTEND and BACKEND. I just found out after working at it for about 90%, that I could use a package in Node JS called EJS (Embedded JavaScript Template) to properly build it as intended.

Anyway, I'm planning to update the code to work with EJS afterwards and will be posting the 3rd Phase or Style of this Budget Web App (should be the proper one finally).

And btw, you can have a look at the first style or the 1.0 of this Budget Web App here, https://jsfiddle.net/lalapolalaanewb/hx0sL5cf/ which I create just using simple HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript with no BACKEND association at all.

Anyway, thank you for spending time reading and trying my Web App. Till next time. Chao!"# Budget-2.0"
